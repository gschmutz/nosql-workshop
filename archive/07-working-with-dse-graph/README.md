# Working with DataStax Graph

In this workshop we will learn the basics of working with the Gremlin query language using the DataStax Graph option.

The environment will also be based on Docker Compose, but we will not use the one provisionend in [01-environment](../01-environment/README.md). We will use a new docker-compose.yml which can be found in the [`docker`](./docker/docker-compose.yml) folder of this workshop. The reason for that is that we have to specify a network for the Datastax docker containers to work properly. 

## Starting DataStax DSE Graph using Docker

Before we can start the environment, we have to create the network which is used by the docker-compose definition. 

```
docker network create nosql
```

now let's navigate to the `07-working-with-dse-graph` folder

```
cd /home/bigdata/nosql-workshop/07-working-with-dse-graph
```

and start the environment using 

```
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

If you get a timeout error, then just redo the `docker-compose up -d` command.

With this docker-compose, 4 services should get started, a single DSE node, an instance of DSE Studio, an instance of OpsCetner and an instance of the DSE Graph Loader. 

To see the log file of the 4 services running, use the following command

```
sudo docker-compose logs -f
```

## Create a new graph schema in DSE Studio

In order to work with DSE-Graph we will be using the graphical environment DSE Studio. It’s a notebook-style UI provided by DataStax. 

In a browser, connect to <http://nosqlplatform:39091> inside the Virtual Machine or use the IP Address of the Virtual Machine to connect from externally (i.e. from the host machine). In Azure don’t forget to open the port 9091 and 9042 on the Networking page (add an inbound rule on TCP for port 9091 and for port 9042).

The following page should appear:

![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-home.png "DSE Studio")


click on the **+** icon.

![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-create-notebook.png "DSE Studio")

Click on **Connection** drop down and select **Add New Connection**. 

![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-create-connection.png "DSE Studio")

Enter `killrvideo` into the **Name** field and `dse-1` into the **Host/IP** field. Click on **Test** to test if connect to DSE Graph works successfully. 

If you get an error, you might have to make sure that port **9042** is reachable. 

Click **Save** and you are back on the CREATE NOTEBOOK pop-up window. 

Click on the **Select a Graph** drop-down and select **Add New Graph**. 

![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-new-graph.png "DSE Studio")

Enter `killrvideo` into the **Name** field and then click **Create** and once again **Create**.

An empty notebook should appear. That’s your working space.

## Create the graph schema

Now we are ready to create the graph schema. The following diagram shows the graph model we are going to implement.

![Alt Image Text](./images/data-model.png "DSE Studio")

Copy the following code and paste it into the empty cell in the notebook. 
 
```
// Define properties 
schema.propertyKey("genreId").Text().create();
schema.propertyKey("personId").Text().create();
schema.propertyKey("userId").Text().create();
schema.propertyKey("movieId").Text().create();
schema.propertyKey("name").Text().create();
schema.propertyKey("age").Int().create();
schema.propertyKey("gender").Text().create();
schema.propertyKey("title").Text().create();
schema.propertyKey("year").Int().create();
schema.propertyKey("duration").Int().create();
schema.propertyKey("country").Text().create();
schema.propertyKey("production").Text().multiple().create();
schema.propertyKey("rating").Int().create();

// Define vertex labels
schema.vertexLabel("genre").properties("genreId","name").create();
schema.vertexLabel("person").properties("personId","name").create();
schema.vertexLabel("user").properties("userId","age","gender").create();
schema.vertexLabel("movie").properties("movieId","title","year","duration","country","production").create();

// Define edge labels
schema.edgeLabel("knows").connection("user","user").create();
schema.edgeLabel("rated").single().properties("rating").connection("user","movie").create();
schema.edgeLabel("belongsTo").single().connection("movie","genre").create();
schema.edgeLabel("actor").connection("movie","person").create();              // multiple() due to data
schema.edgeLabel("director").single().connection("movie","person").create();
schema.edgeLabel("composer").single().connection("movie","person").create();
schema.edgeLabel("screenwriter").connection("movie","person").create();       // multiple() due to data
schema.edgeLabel("cinematographer").single().connection("movie","person").create();

// Define vertex indexes
schema.vertexLabel("genre").index("genresById").materialized().by("genreId").add();
schema.vertexLabel("genre").index("genresByName").materialized().by("name").add();
schema.vertexLabel("person").index("personsById").materialized().by("personId").add();
schema.vertexLabel("person").index("personsByName").materialized().by("name").add();
schema.vertexLabel("user").index("usersById").materialized().by("userId").add();
schema.vertexLabel("user").index("usersByAge").secondary().by("age").add();
schema.vertexLabel("movie").index("moviesById").materialized().by("movieId").add();
schema.vertexLabel("movie").index("moviesByTitle").materialized().by("title").add();
schema.vertexLabel("movie").index("moviesByYear").secondary().by("year").add();

// Define edge indexes
schema.vertexLabel("user").index("toMoviesByRating").outE("rated").by("rating").add();
schema.vertexLabel("movie").index("toUsersByRating").inE("rated").by("rating").add();
```

The notebook should now look like the diagram below:
 
![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-run-notebook.png "DSE Studio")

Either click on the **Real-Time >** Button with the arrow in the upper right corner or hit **SHIFT-Enter** to execute the cell. 

It will take a few seconds to create the schema. 

## Load data into the graph

We will be using data from IMDB. It has been taken from the [graph-examples](https://github.com/datastax/graph-examples) project provided by DataStax on GitHub. In that project you can also find other interesting examples showing DSE Graph in action.

To load the data, we will use the DSE Graph Loader started previously with docker-compose. The folder with the example files has been mapped into the `graph-loader` container as `/graph-examples`. 

```
  graph-loader:
    image: trivadis/dse-graphloader
    container_name: graph-loader
    hostname: graph-loader
    depends_on:
      - dse-1
    volumes:
      - ./graph-examples:/graph-examples
    networks:
      - nosql 
    restart: always
```

Navigate into the running graph-loader docker container

```
docker exec -ti graph-loader bash
```

and change to the `/graph-examples/killrvideo` folder

```
cd /graph-examples/killrvideo/
```

Now start the graph loader using the [`killrvideo-mapping.groovy`](./docker/graph-examples/killrvideo/killrvideo-mapping.groovy) mapping file. 

```
/root/dse-graph-loader-6.7.3/graphloader -address dse-1 killrvideo-mapping.groovy -graph killrvideo -preparation false
``` 

The loader should start importing data which you can see in the log

![Alt Image Text](./images/graph-loader-run.png "DSE Studio")

It takes a few minutes for the load to finish. 

![Alt Image Text](./images/graph-loader-finished.png "DSE Studio")
  
## Using the Movie graph

Now with the loaded graph in place, let's start using it. Switch back to the DSE Studio and submit the following Gremlin queries in separate cells. 

### Simple Counts

First let's see how many vertices the graph has in total.  

```
g.V().count()
```

We should get the following error, as the standard settings of DSE Graph does not allow for scanning the whole graph. 

![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-scan-error.png "DSE Studio")
 
You can change this with the `allow_scan` option 

```
schema.config().option('graph.allow_scan').set('true')
```

Now try again, the count the number of vertices should be returned.

```
g.V().count()
```

![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-count.png "DSE Studio")


For each vertex in the graph, emit its label, then group and count each distinct label

```
g.V().label().groupCount()
```

![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-group-count.png "DSE Studio")

### Simple Graph Traversals

Let’s start with a simple traversal to return the director of the Movie titled `Alice in Wonderland`

```
g. 
  V(). 
      has("title","Alice in Wonderland").     
      has("year",2010). 
      out("director"). 
      values("name")
```
 
We can see that it has been directed by `Tim Burton`.

Now let's both see the director and the screenwriter for this movie. 

```
g. 
  V(). 
      has("title","Alice in Wonderland").     
      has("year",2010). 
      union(__.out("director"),
            out("screenwriter")). 
      values("name")
```

![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-director-and-screenwriter.png "DSE Studio")

Let's find all movies where `Johnny Depp` acted in and which were released after 2010

```
g.V().
  hasLabel("person").  
  has("name","Johnny Depp").  
  in("actor").  
  has("year",gt(2010)).  
  values("title")
```

We can see 2 movies: `Pirates of the Cribbean: On Stranger Tides` and `Into the Woods`.

Now let's find ages of users who left 7 or 8 star rating for Johnny Depp’s movies released in 2010 or later:

```
g.V().
  hasLabel("person").  
  has("name","Johnny Depp").  
  in("actor").  
  has("year",gte(2010)).  
  inE("rated").
  has("rating", within(7,8)).
  outV().
  values("age")
```

![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-star-rating.png "DSE Studio")

Find Johnny Depp’s movies and display the titles. 

```
g.V().has("person","name","Johnny Depp").
      as("actor"). 
      in("actor").as("movie"). 
      select("actor","movie"). 
      by("name"). 
      by("title")
```

Find Johnny Depp’s movies and display its title, year, and genre

```
g.V().has("person","name","Johnny Depp").
      as("a"). 
      in("actor").as("t","y").
      out("belongsTo").as("g"). 
      select("a","t","y","g"). 
      by("name").by("title").by("year").by("name").
      sample(3)
```

Find directors who appeared in their own movies

```
g.V().match(
     __.as("m").out("actor").as("p"),   
     __.as("m").out("director").as("p")).   
   select("p").by("name").dedup()
```

Of course the result will display `Quentin Tarantino` among others.

![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-directors.png "DSE Studio")


### Outgoing Edges of "Alice in Wonderland"

Now let’s get the movie titled `Alice in Wonderland` and show all out-going Edges:

```
g.V().has("movie","title","Alice in Wonderland").outE()
```

![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-outgoing.png "DSE Studio")

We can still see a grid-style view of the results. But when navigating over edges, we can also switch to a graph style view. Click on the icon to the right (just above the graph).

![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-graph-view.png "DSE Studio")

We can see a lot of colored circles, these are the vertices and the links between them, the edges. But we only see the id fields, it would be much better to see some other properties. We can change that by navigating to the Graph Settings` button on the upper right.

![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-graph-settings.png "DSE Studio")

Click on the tab **Display Names** and enter `{{{name}}}` into the **genre** field, `{{{title}}}` into the **movie** field and `{{{name}}}` into the **person** field. You can see that the labels in the graph change accordingly. 

![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-graph-settings-2.png "DSE Studio")

Now we can see that in fact there are two movies titled `Alice in Wonderland`, the yellow circles in the middle with `person` and `genre` vertices around them. We can also see that 3 `genre` vertices are the ones linking the two subgraphs together.

If we navigate the mouse on one of the vertices, you will see a details window pop-up showing the values of all the properties for the given vertex. 
 
![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-graph-view-with-details.png "DSE Studio")

We can now see that these are in fact two different movies with the same title, one published in the year `1951` and the other one in `2010`. We can also see the none of persons were involed in the production of both movies. Both movies are categorized as `Animation`, `Fantasy` and `Adventure`. 

You can also further navigate in the graph. Let's see in what other movies Jonny Depp played by right clicking on his node and select **Expand Neighborhood**.

![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-expand.png "DSE Studio")
  
Let's select **actor {13)** for **Edge Labels to Expand** and click on **Add Egeds to View**. 

![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-expand-2.png "DSE Studio")

The graph will expand and result in a new graph view. You can manually arange the nodes to make it more visually meaningful

![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-expand-3.png "DSE Studio")
 

### Incoming Edges of "Alice in Wonderland"

Next let’s get all in-coming Edges for the same two movies:

```
g.V().has("movie","title","Alice in Wonderland").inE()
```

Again switch to the graph view and change the display properties. Under **Display Name**, enter `{{{title}}}` into the **movie** field and `{{{label}}}:{{{userId}}}` into the **user** field. This time let's also changge the **Color By** drop-down on the **Style** tab to `Out Degree`.
 
![Alt Image Text](./images/dse-studio-in-coming.png "DSE Studio")

We see the two movies, again in the middle, surrounded by all the users who have reated the two movies.   
Additionally we can easily see that only one of all the users (with id `u185`) has rated both movies. The vertex for the user has a different color, because we have changed the **Color By** setting to `Out Degree`.
